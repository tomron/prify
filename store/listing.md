## Detailed Description

**The Problem**

GitHub displays Pull Request files alphabetically. While simple, this ordering often obscures the logical flow of changes. Reviewers waste time jumping between related files, understanding dependencies becomes harder, and the natural story of the code changes gets lost. For large PRs with dozens of files, alphabetical order turns code review into a frustrating puzzle-solving exercise.

**The Solution**

PR File Reorder lets you and your team create the ideal review sequence. Reorder files to match how they should be reviewed: dependencies first, core logic next, tests and documentation last. Your entire team collaborates on the ordering, and a consensus algorithm automatically applies the best sequence for everyone.

**Key Features**

• Drag-and-Drop Reordering: Intuitive interface to reorganize PR files instantly. Move files into logical review order—dependencies first, entry points next, tests last—whatever makes sense for your codebase.

• Team Collaboration: Share your preferred file order with teammates via GitHub comments. See how others think the PR should be reviewed and learn from different perspectives.

• Democratic Consensus: When multiple reviewers suggest orderings, an intelligent consensus algorithm merges them into a single optimal sequence. Everyone's input counts equally, and orders can be updated anytime.

• Zero Setup Required: No backend servers, no configuration, no API keys. Orders are stored as GitHub PR comments, leveraging infrastructure you already use. Works entirely in your browser.

• Privacy First: No data collection, no external tracking, no analytics. Your file order preferences stay in your browser. Shared orders are public GitHub comments—transparent by design.

**Perfect For**

Code review teams who want faster, more efficient PR reviews. Especially valuable for large PRs (20+ files) where alphabetical ordering hides the logical flow. Great for teams that value democratic decision-making and reviewer experience.

**Technical Details**

Works on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. Manifest V3 extension with minimal permissions (storage + github.com access only). Open source and community-driven.
